## New Blog - noting down things here for my own sanity.

Most of the content from this original post will be from the blog by [Chad Baldwin](https://github.com/chadbaldwin). All credit goes to them for the original blog content. This is just a remix for my own use.

# Testing blog capabilities

Let's test this out. I'm going to toss together a quick shell script on another github repo. 

## Goal

# Notes

- The above header (Markdown on line 1) will be automatically used as the pages title due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings`.
    - This is supported by GitHub Pages by default.
- _posts without a Markdown header will be drivedd from filename
- Code blocks can be provided like so:
#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
